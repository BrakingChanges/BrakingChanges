### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently working on [GEFS-Radial-Bearing](https://github.com/Tech-Helper503/GEFS-Radial-Bearing), an application that simply acts more generally as an EFB  

[!Vatsim Indicator](https://my.vatsim.net/indicators/1746386)

Fun fact: Cicadas have the strongest pee in the animal kingdom, with speeds of up to 3 m/s
